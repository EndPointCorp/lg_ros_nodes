'''
A :ref:`task queue <apps-taskqueue>` application implements several
:class:`Job` classes which specify the way a :class:`.Task` is run.
Each :class:`Job` class is a :class:`.Task` factory, therefore,
a :class:`.Task` is always associated
with one :class:`Job`, which can be of two types:

* standard (:class:`.Job`)
* periodic (:class:`.PeriodicJob`), a generator of scheduled tasks.

.. _job-callable:

Job callable method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To define a job is simple, subclass from :class:`.Job` and implement the
**job callable method**::

    from pulsar.apps import tasks

    class Addition(tasks.Job):

        def __call__(self, consumer, a=0, b=0):
            "Add two numbers"
            return a+b

The ``consumer``, instance of :class:`.TaskConsumer`,
is passed by the :ref:`Task backend <apps-taskqueue-backend>` and should
always be the first positional parameter in the callable method.
The remaining (optional key-valued only!) parameters are needed by
your job implementation.

A :ref:`job callable <job-callable>` can also return a
:ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` if it needs to perform asynchronous IO during its
execution::

    class Crawler(tasks.Job):

        def __call__(self, consumer, sample=100, size=10):
            response = yield http.request(...)
            content = response.content
            ...

This allows for cooperative task execution.

.. _job-non-overlap:

Non overlapping Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :attr:`~.Job.can_overlap` attribute controls the way tasks are generated
by a specific :class:`.Job`. By default, a :class:`.Job` creates a new task
every time the :class:`.TaskBackend` requests it.

However, when setting the :attr:`~.Job.can_overlap` attribute to ``False``,
a new task cannot be started unless a previous task of the same job
is done.
